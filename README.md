# Nucleotide Noise

-   [Static (original) version](https://sqyphen.github.io/nucleotide-noise/index.html)
-   [Small motion version (not too large as is currently a resource hug)](https://sqyphen.github.io/nucleotide-noise/variations/motion/index.html)

Saw a data visualisation at an event and wanted to have a go at recreating it.

I think it came out quite close.
